### Hi there 👋

About me: I write stuff, and obsess over books + products.

My childhood consisted of constantly asking those "why" questions all the time and as an adult, I haven't stopped.

I'm the person who likes to get into the details. I try to make logical decisions based on facts (but mostly fail to), and must have everything organized and planned out.

Stumbled into Product Management couple of months ago and now my daily life involves getting to know every info available out there about this amazing field :)

I work by the philosophy: The most powerful step that anyone can take to turn their dreams into a reality is a simple one: you just need to start. The only real way to find out if your idea is a good one is to do it. You'll learn more in one hour of doing something than in a lifetime of thinking about it.

I'm also a content creator and love to play with the power of words in my free time.

I enjoy meeting people and hearing new perspectives. So, reach out to me if you want to chat about products, music or just need an ear :)  </p>
