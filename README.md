### Hi there 👋

About me: I write stuff, and obsess over books + products.

My childhood consisted of constantly asking those "why" questions all the time and as an adult, I haven't stopped.

Stumbled into Product Management couple of years ago and now my daily life involves getting to know every info available out there about this amazing field :)

I work by the philosophy: The most powerful step that anyone can take to turn their dreams into a reality is a simple one: you just need to start. The only real way to find out if your idea is a good one is to do it. You'll learn more in one hour of doing something than in a lifetime of thinking about it.

I'm also a content creator and love to play with the power of words in my free time.

I enjoy meeting people and hearing new perspectives. So, reach out to me if you want to chat about products, music or just need an ear :)  </p>
